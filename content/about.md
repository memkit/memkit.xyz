memkit is the brainchild of three founder friends that met at ETHDenver in 2023

Stanislav Srednyak and David West met during BUIDLweek and had a conversation that would mark the Genesis of Timelines, their first product.

With the help of Forest Kunecke they smashed together their first prototype.
