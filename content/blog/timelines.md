We are excited to announce that we are showcasing a prototype of our first product, TimeLines.

In our daily lives we have immeasurable opportunities to capture our moments of inspiration.

TimeLines was founded with the purpose of not only making this easier, but keeping privacy and sovereignty as a first-thought, not an after-thought.

Today we presented our vision, and we'd like to share it with you.
